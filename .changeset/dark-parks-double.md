Remove Tauri Yet Again

It's too frustrating to work with whilst auth was working everything else was frustrating. 

The primary issue is that I can't provide a custom url for the server function backend so, if I was to run the client as an SPA locally and have a server rendered version running on the main domain I wouldn't be able to tell the SPA version to use the server function from the main domain as it would always try to use the url relative to wherever the SPA is being served.

Additionally I had an issue where the application would freeze every time I tried to access the Scanin function. It's too frustrating to setup and I would rather invest my time in getting error handling or the Discord bot portion to work better.
