<h1 align="center">Team 3132 Attendance System</h1>

The Team3132 Attendance System is a full stack application designed for two purposes. 

1. Checking student volunteers in and out of outreach events and tallying their outreach hours.
2. Collecting RSVPs for team meetings and conducting attendance.

# Usage

Usage is still to be documented but a basic guide can be found on the internal team wiki with a public version coming soon.

# Installation

The application is packaged and deployed using the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) ecosystem which, if you want to deploy the application for people to use needs to be installed on the host system.

The production version of the application deployed for use by Team 3132 is automatically updated when there's a new release. The configuration for the automatic deployment can be found in the `./deploy` folder and in the Github environment variables.
